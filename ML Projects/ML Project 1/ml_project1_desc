In this ml project I made a ml model to predict the house price for a imaginary company "Dragon Real Estates" to increase its profit by making good prediction. To do so I first collected the data and did some data visualisation by finding correlations and plotting graphs. Then I did data cleaning by imputing median values to missing data. Then I did stratified-test-train splitting. All this was done under a single pipeline. A Pipeline helps to modify data in future with less effort. Then I checked which ml model is good for given data and can predict with less error. I used LinearRegression, DecissionTree and RandomForest, after which I found RandomForest was best for my data and predicted with less error without overfitting. Then I used joblib to save the model and turn it into usage form.
