In this project I used LogisticRegression to classify hand-written digits. I got to know accuracy is not the best means to evaluate classifier as in this project I want to know whether a digit is a 2 or not. Then is 90% chance that a digit is not 2. So our least accuracy can be 90% which seems very high but not correct. I got the data from MNIST dataset which is 70000*784 data. Each data row has 784 features which nothing but pixel values for a 28*28 image. Pixel values can range from 0 to 255. This model was showing accuracy of about 97%.
